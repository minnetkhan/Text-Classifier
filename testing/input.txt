NEW YORK -- The Yankees’ formula for a deep October run centers upon their big-swinging lineup and an equally strong bullpen, one that they believe will ultimately give them the edge in this power-versus-power American League Division Series showdown with the Twins.

It can’t hurt that they have history on their side: the names have changed, but the outcome remained the same on Friday. DJ LeMahieu homered and drove in four runs, Brett Gardner also went deep and the Yankees’ prized relief corps combined for 4 1/3 strong innings, fueling a 10-4 victory over Minnesota in Game 1 of the ALDS at Yankee Stadium.

“I feel like we had a lot of opportunities to score with a lot of guys on base,” LeMahieu said. “We did a really good job against their pitchers. To come through there in a couple of situations felt good."

The Yankees improved to 101-37 against the Twins since 2002, including 14-2 in the postseason, where they have won 11 straight over Minnesota -- the franchise’s longest postseason winning streak against any opponent. Though they aren’t hyping themselves with highlight reels of the Derek Jeter era, Aaron Judge said that they can borrow something from the more recent chapters.

“A lot of guys here were on the 2017 team when we were down 3-0 to Minnesota [in the first inning of the AL Wild Card Game],” Judge said. “Past experience like that, you can feed off of. Once we got that first run, you just focus on your at-bats and do your job. We'll be where we want to be.”
